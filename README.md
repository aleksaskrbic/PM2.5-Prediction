# PM2.5-Prediction

The main topic of this project is the data analysis concentration PM2.5 particles and them influence on air quality. By analyzing the data available to us, there is the way for create a model for their prediction, which can result in the reduction of these particles and enable safer and better life. Linear Regression is used for prediction of PM2.5 particles.
